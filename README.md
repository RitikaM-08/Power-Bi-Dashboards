## Problem Statement

This dashboard helps the company understand their customers, sales, and profits better. It helps them to know what are the products that their customers are interested in as well as the products that offer them the highest profits. 
It also lets them know the shipping modes that are preferred by the customers so that they can enhance their user experience. 
The company can also know the extent of their business so that they can take informed decisions about their marketing and promotional activities.
Since, the highest sales and profits are from France, thus in all they must work on improving their services and marketing in other regions as well.
